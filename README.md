# DEVJOBS

![Devjobs-Preview](https://github.com/jakealistairwood/github-jobs-api/blob/master/src/img/preview.jpg)

Devjobs is a frontendmentor.io challenge where I had to replicate the design from scratch, from the Figma mockup to the fully-fledged product it is now. It uses the Github jobs API to display a collection of recently advertised roles. 

I used axios to fetch the data and Postman to query the various API requests.The data was then passed down as props to the various components in which it was needed, e.g. To the searchbar and job cards.

The application features a searchbar where a user can filter out the roles based on the title, role, location and whether its full-time/part-time. Also, the application features a light/dark mode which I implemented using styled components. 

## Tech

* Functional React
* React Router
* Styled Components
* Pagination
* Postman
* SCSS

## Todos

* Finish responsiveness so it replicates mockup design (e.g. adding modal for mobile view).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
